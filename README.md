Not a bot , but a script which searches and opens up my answer images to my test questions based on keywords.
To use this, import tesseract module and download tessatact executable for windows: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
Update the executable path and answer images folder path in the code with your own path.
Should integrate with selenium to automate with my online test.
